title: About Me
---

Welcome to my blog, my name is Ethan Miller, and over the last couple of years it's been my goal to combine my passion for Python development, statistics, and sports into a fulfilling career. I spent the last two years at The College of Saint Rose working on master's degrees in computer science and business analytics, and also worked with the men's basketball team as a graduate assistant. Over that time, I've amassed an absurd amount of data from the NE10, CACC, and ECC conferences within the NCAA's Division 2 East Region. Many of these posts will likely be a deeper dive on that data, but some other sports related data and Python projects will likely be touched on as well.

In my free time, I've spent the last three years training to complete the World Marathon Majors for various charities with roughly $25,000 raised to date. I'll be wrapping up my 6th and final race this fall as I head back to my home state to take on the New York City Marathon, becoming one of less than 5,000 people in the world to complete each major.
